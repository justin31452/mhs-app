MHS-APP
===

## Outline

This is a cross-platform mobile application built for Ming Hui Sheng Enterprise Co., Ltd. 

There used to be only desktop application available. Thus, managers needed to write down each data and then brought it into the factory to check the production capacity.

On the other hand, team leaders had to take notes in the facroty and then type them all over again using the only desktop locate in a 100 thousand sq ft factory. 

With MHS-APP, now they can just scan the barcode and query/insert the database using their cellphones without wasting time and energy wandering around.
