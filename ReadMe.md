## ðŸ“ˆ  Outline

This is a cross-platform mobile application built for Ming Hui Sheng Enterprise Co., Ltd.

There used to be only a desktop application available. Therefore managers needed to write down each data and then brought it into the factory to check the production capacity.

On the other hand, team leaders had to take notes in the factory and then type them all over again using the only desktop located in a 100 thousand sq ft factory.

With MHS-APP, they can just scan barcodes and query/insert the Mysql database using their cellphones without wasting unnecessary time and energy anymore.
